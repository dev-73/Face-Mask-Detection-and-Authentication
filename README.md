# Face-Mask-Detection-and-Authentication-
The world is struggling with Covid-19 pandemic and are so many essential equipment’s needed to combat against Corona virus. One of such most essential is Face Mask and mask was not mandatory for everyone but as the day surpasses scientist and Doctors have recommended everyone to wear the mask. Therefore, to detect whether a person is wearing Face Mask or not, there are detection technique. Face Mask Detection is a project based on Artificial Intelligence. General view of this project is detect people with or without mask. In this project we use image data which is in form of with mask and without mask and all the photos are in form of artificial mask. In making of this project, we have two phases. Train model using Convolution or any pretrained model which detect face masks in images. Then, detect faces in video or images and get prediction from our trained model. We make four models in this project which are ResNet, AlexNet, GoogleNet and VGG. After making model we implement live face mask detection. If model will not detect face mask, then it will beep sound and alert people. ResNet gives accurate result also VGG gives good result but AlexNet and GoogleNet create confusion while detecting.
